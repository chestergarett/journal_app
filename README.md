JOURNAL APP CONCEPT.

****** ONGOING REDEPLOYMENT - deployment in Heroku is not functional because it does not render the REACT components. ************ 

Since twitter is the modern day journal, decided to make a Twitter clone.

sample credentials:
  username: chestergarett1@gmail.com
  password: test

***** suggest to 1) git clone 2) bundle install 3) rails s to view the current page for now.

****** front end index page was done using REACT via react-rails gem, backend developed using RAILS ***************
